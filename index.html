					<!-- about you -->
                    Energized, dynamic tech enthusiast with a two-year of a software engineering background and experience in customer service. Extensive experience working with different cross-cultural teams in Brazil, Chile, and, USA. Establishing key relationships between organizations, companies and stakeholders in different levels towards business goals. 

Growing up, I always stood up for those who wasn't being heard. I am a big believer that everyone has things to contribute and share, so we must make sure they have their space. I am a passionate about tech sales, problem solving and promoting diversity. I am a business analytics student getting my undergraduate degree in BS, Business Analytics with emphasis on Marketing with 2 years of software engineering major background. I am currently a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador. I was selected to amplify impact and bring together peers to learn new skills, solve real-world problems, and build vibrant digital communities across the globe

I am passionate about empowering women, but especially minorities, grow their personal businesses online. I like to help small businesses grow through a strategic and professional position online. In my free time, I have a project called “Qualidade Pra viver”. The main purpose of this project it is to help small businesses in Brazil to create an online presence. In that way, helping them grow in revenue and give them more flexibility to stay at home to be while they also support their family. 

When I am not studying or working, I am looking for my next adventure. My next hiking, my next book to read, my next movie, my next place
